This project is a Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) pregnancy food checker app. Use Next.js API Routes for backend logic (Gemini API integration, image analysis, etc). UI components should be modern and accessible. Prioritize Vercel deployment compatibility.

Follow t_wada's recommended TDD (Test-Driven Development) practices for all code and test generation. Write tests first, keep feedback cycles short, and refactor incrementally. Prioritize readable, maintainable, and minimal code.
